Updating to qe-6.0. (Now it use the name `qe` instead of `espresso`)
Uploaded to github.
Changed the the name to `ffr-learns-qe`.

Updating to espresso-5.4.0

* No flib directory now. Its functionality is replace by LAXlib

* New GVECW module to contain the variables ecutwfc, ecfixed, etc
  So, any statements that contain USE wvfct, ONLY : ecutwfc will result
  in error.

Updating to espresso-5.3.0.

* FFT subroutines are isolated to separate directory: FFTXlib
  Include and library paths must be changed accordingly.

* All calls to flush_unit are replaced by FLUSH( stdout )



Project: implementing steepest descent (SD) method to solve Kohn-Sham
equations.

We need to evaluate total energy, given wavefunction coefficients
as the input. Most likely I need to learn the functions and subroutine needed to
calculate the total energy.

Currently, I don't know yet where the Poisson solver need to be
updated.
Probably the it will be after doing one SD update.

How about the orthogonality problem?

****

Alternatively, the DFT++ formalism may be used.
One initial important task that is needed is to implement various
operators.
